CreateProcess() Windows API Command-Line Utility
================================================

[![Build status](https://github.com/rgl/createprocess-windows/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rgl/createprocess-windows/actions?query=workflow%3ABuild)

A complete, robust command-line utility to construct highly customized calls to the CreateProcess() Windows API to start new processes.  Released under a MIT or LGPL license.

This project is intended primarily for use from batch files (.bat) to execute other programs.  If it can be done with CreateProcess(), it can be done with this command-line program.

Why would you need this?  One use-case would be for programs that don't play nice even with the 'start' command.  For example, Apache 'httpd.exe' hangs the command-line even with 'start /B /MIN' but running this program with `/f=DETACHED_PROCESS` to start Apache and it runs completely in the background.  I developed this initially for Apache (way overkill for one feature), but I've had need for this program for other things on many different occasions, including starting processes from scripting languages that don't offer sufficient facilities on Windows.

Features
--------

* Command-line action!
* Verbose mode tells you exactly how CreateProcess() will be called.  No more guessing!
* Can redirect stdin, stdout, and stderr to TCP/IP sockets.  Avoid blocking on anonymous pipes or storing output in files!
* Can use named mutexes and semaphores to control how many processes can run at the same time.
* Start elevated processes (UAC support).
* Start child processes as any valid user without requiring the user's credentials.  Including the powerful NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account!
* Pre-built binaries using Visual Studio (statically linked C++ runtime, minimal file size of ~162K, direct Win32 API calls).
* Console and Windows subsystem variants.
* Unicode support.
* Offers almost everything CreateProcess() offers plus a couple of nice extras (e.g. output the process ID to a file).
* Has a liberal open source license.  MIT or LGPL, your choice.
* Sits on GitHub for all of that pull request and issue tracker goodness to easily submit changes and ideas respectively.

        Less secure than using /sockettokenlen and stdin.

        /sockettokenlen=TokenLength
        Specifies the length of the token to read from stdin.
        When specified, a token must be sent for each socket.

        /stdin=FileOrEmptyOrsocket
        Sets the STARTUPINFO.hStdInput handle for the new process.
        When this option is empty, INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE is used.
        When this option is 'socket', the /socket IP and port are used.
        When this option is not specified, the current stdin is used.

        /stdout=FileOrEmptyOrsocket
        Sets the STARTUPINFO.hStdOutput handle for the new process.
        When this option is empty, INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE is used.
        When this option is 'socket', the /socket IP and port are used.
        When this option is not specified, the current stdout is used.

        /stderr=FileOrEmptyOrstdoutOrsocket
        Sets the STARTUPINFO.hStdError handle for the new process.
        When this option is empty, INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE is used.

        When this option is not specified, the current stderr is used.

        /attach[=ProcessID]
        Attempt to attach to a parent OR a specific process' console.
        Also resets standard handles back to defaults.
```

Example usage:

```
C:\>createprocess /f=DETACHED_PROCESS "C:\Program Files\Apache\httpd.exe"
```

That starts Apache with a detached console so it runs entirely in the background.

Another example:

```
C:\>whoami
my-pc\john-doh

C:\>whoami /priv

That starts a Command Prompt child process as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (the most powerful user account in Windows) in the same console session of the parent non-elevated process with full SYSTEM privileges and merges the current environment variables with the SYSTEM user's environment variables.

Learn how the various `/...token` options work by watching the video linked to at the top of this repo or just [look at the insane diagram](https://github.com/cubiclesoft/createprocess-windows/blob/master/starting_a_child_process_as_another_user_diagram.png).

Even the most hardcore command-line enthusiast should be drooling right now due to brain melt.  Be sure to check out the source code.

Windows Subsystem Variant
-------------------------

While `createprocess.exe` is intended for use with console apps, `createprocess-win.exe` is intended for detached console and GUI applications.  Starting `createprocess.exe` in certain situations will briefly flash a console window before starting the target process.  Calling `createprocess-win.exe` instead will no longer show the console window.

Why not just use `createprocess-win.exe`?  Since `createprocess-win.exe` starts as a Windows GUI application, there is the tendency for it to be run in the background and may not behave as expected with various handles.  The software is a little bit trickier to work with as a result.  It's also a few KB larger than `createprocess.exe`.

There is one additional option specifically for `createprocess-win.exe` called `/attach` which attempts to attach to the console of the parent process (if any) and will also reset the standard handles.  The `/attach` option, if used, should generally be specified before other options.

TCP/IP Notes
------------

The TCP/IP socket options represent a security risk so take proper precautions.  Example usage can be seen in the [ProcessHelper class](https://github.com/cubiclesoft/php-misc/blob/master/support/process_helper.php).

In addition, passing SOCKET handles to the target process causes problems.  Sometimes the target process works just fine and sometimes it doesn't.  To deal with this issue, up to three threads are started, one for each of the standard handles.  Each thread routes data between its socket handle and an associated anonymous pipe of the started process.  As a consequence of using the TCP/IP socket option, the `/w` option is always set so that the started process is waited on (i.e. so the threads can transfer data).  This doesn't exactly matter as the `/w` option would be used anyway by the caller when passing socket options.
